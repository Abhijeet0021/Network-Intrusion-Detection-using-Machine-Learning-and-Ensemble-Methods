## 📄 Project Overview

This project presents a **comparative study** of traditional machine learning models and ensemble learning algorithms for **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)** using the **NSL-KDD dataset**.  
The main goal is to improve the detection of both **common** and **rare** cyberattacks by applying:
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** for feature selection, and  
- **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)** for synthetic data generation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate and compare traditional ML models (SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with ensemble models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).  
- Handle data imbalance for rare attacks (R2L, U2R) using **synthetic data generation**.  
- Improve model robustness and accuracy through **feature selection** and **cross-validation**.  
- Measure model performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **AUC-ROC**.

---

## 🧩 Dataset
**Dataset Used:** [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)  
- 41 features per record  
- 4 main attack categories:
  - 🧨 Denial of Service (DoS)  
  - 🔍 Probe  
  - 🐚 Remote to Local (R2L)  
  - 🔑 User to Root (U2R)  
- Addressed **class imbalance** by augmenting minority classes using **Conditional GANs**.  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers  
- Encoded categorical features (`protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`)  
- Normalized numerical features  

### 2. Feature Selection
- Applied **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to remove irrelevant or redundant attributes.  

### 3. Synthetic Data Generation
- Used **Conditional GANs (cGANs)** to balance dataset by generating realistic attack samples.  

### 4. Model Training
- Implemented multiple models:
  - **Traditional:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
  - **Ensemble:** AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- AUC-ROC

## 📊 Results Summary

| Attack Type | Best Model | Accuracy | AUC-ROC | Key Insight |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **DoS** | XGBoost | 0.93 | 0.93 | Strong detection due to pattern consistency |
| **Probe** | AdaBoost | 0.8946 | 0.94 | Effective at identifying probing activities |
| **U2R** | Gradient Boosting | 0.995 | 0.92 | High recall, handles rare patterns well |
| **R2L** | XGBoost | 0.78 | 0.93 | Hardest to detect due to class imbalance |

🧩 Ensemble models consistently **outperformed traditional ML** methods, particularly for rare attacks.
